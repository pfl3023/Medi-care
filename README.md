A Medical Query RAG Application
Overview
This application is designed to answer medical queries using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It leverages BioBERT for embeddings, a Qdrant vector database for storage, and FastAPI for the backend service. The user-friendly frontend is built using Bootstrap.

Backend Overview
<h3>Main.py</h3>
Imports: Necessary libraries for loading documents, processing text, and managing embeddings.
Embedding Initialization: Initializes HuggingFaceEmbeddings using the biobert-base-cased-v1.1 model.
Document Loading: Loads PDF files from the data/ directory using DirectoryLoader.
Text Splitting: Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to break down documents into manageable chunks.
Vector Database Creation: Creates a Qdrant vector database to store the embeddings.
Suggestions for Improvement
Error Handling: Add error handling for document loading and database interactions.
Logging: Use Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module instead of print statements for better tracking.
Configuration: Move configurable parameters to a configuration file or use command-line arguments.
Environment Variables: Load sensitive information from environment variables.
Testing: Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of document loading and embedding generation.

<h3>Retriever.py</h3>h3>
FastAPI Initialization: Sets up CORS, templates, and static files.
LLM Initialization: Initializes the LlamaCpp model for natural language processing.
Qdrant Setup: Connects to a Qdrant instance and creates a collection if it doesn't exist.
Embedding Generation: Generates and uploads embeddings to Qdrant.
Retrieval Chain: Defines a RetrievalQA chain for querying documents based on user input.
Web Routes: Handles web requests, serving the frontend and processing queries.
Suggestions for Improvement
Error Handling: Expand error handling for specific exceptions.
Configuration Management: Move configurations to a separate config file.
Documentation: Add docstrings for functions and classes.
Async Functionality: Implement asynchronous operations for better responsiveness.
Security Enhancements: Consider adding authentication or rate limiting.
Frontend Enhancements: Ensure the frontend handles asynchronous requests effectively.
Frontend Overview
Frontend (frontend.html)
A clean and user-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.
Captures user queries, sends them to the backend, and displays responses along with context and source documents.
Suggestions for Improvement
Loading Indicators: Implement visually appealing loading indicators during API calls.
Error Messages: Provide clear error messages on the frontend.
Accessibility: Ensure accessibility by using proper ARIA attributes.
Styling Consistency: Maintain consistent styling for an improved user experience.
